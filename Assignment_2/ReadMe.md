**Building your own regression methods**

In this assignment, we will be building our own regression methods (linear regression, knn regression, regression tree) and evaluating their performance on sample dataset. Next we will implement scikit-learn modules for these regression methods on real-world big data (containing 13 dimensions) and evaluating their performance.

This assignment is a part of the course CS 589 taught by Prof. Justin Domke at UMass Amherst, Spring '21.
